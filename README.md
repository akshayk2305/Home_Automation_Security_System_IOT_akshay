## Project Overview
- We successfully developed a Smart Home Monitoring System using a combination of sensors, Arduino, and ESP8266 (NodeMCU module).
- This IoT-based project aims to enhance home safety by monitoring crucial parameters like temperature, humidity, ultrasonic data, and gas levels.
- Additionally, an alert system with a buzzer has been integrated to ensure timely notifications.

## Components Used
Sensors:
- Temperature Sensor
- Humidity Sensor
- Ultrasonic Sensor
- Gas Sensor

## Microcontrollers
- Arduino
- ESP8266 (NodeMCU module) for Wi-Fi connectivity

## Alert System:
- Buzzer for immediate alerts

## Functionality
- The Smart Home Monitoring System utilizes various sensors to collect real-time data, ensuring comprehensive monitoring of the home environment.
- The sensors' output is then processed by Arduino and transmitted via the ESP8266 module, enabling Wi-Fi connectivity for remote access.
- The system incorporates the Blynk app, providing a user-friendly interface for remote monitoring and control.
- Users can conveniently access and manage the gathered data through the Blynk app, enhancing the overall convenience of home safety management.

## Key Features
- Real-time monitoring of temperature, humidity, ultrasonic, and gas levels.
- Immediate alerts through a buzzer for timely notifications.
- Integration with the Blynk app for seamless remote access and control.
- IoT Implementation
